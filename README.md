# OCSF to STIX
A mapping of OCSF entities to STIX 2.1 entities.

# Rationale

ALthough STIX 2.1 relates mostly to threat intelligence representations whereas OCSF describes for now cyber security events there are definetly overlaps and connection points that can be established to move from one domain to the other.

# Solution

The purpose of this tool and conversion schema is to convert from OCSF entities to equivalent STIX 2.1 entities to enable for example a security operator to promote a security event to artifacts for threat intelligence sharing.
